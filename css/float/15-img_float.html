    <h2>Let an image float to the right in a paragraph</h2>
    <p>In the paragraph below, the image will float to the right. A dotted black border is added to the image. We have also added margins to the image to push the text away from the image: 0 px margin on the top and right side, 15 px margin on the bottom, and 20 px margin on the left side of the image.</p>
